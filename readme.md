# Ultimate Nodejs Boilerplate Code 2023

This boilerplate is the latest version of Doctrine 2021 boilerplate code. If you are looking to start a Nodejs project with typescript, their are tons of things that need to be setup to run a successful project. Having 3 layer architecture in mind, this allows you to integrate libraries easily. I have also added Agenda for Type Di (DI) alongside Agendda for job scheduling. You can replace them with Bee, Bull or Bree as per your requirements.
